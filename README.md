# Recursions

This repository contains a collection of classic recursion problems implemented in Java.  
It serves as a focused learning resource to understand different types of recursion patterns and their applications.

## Contents

- **Factorial.java** — Classic factorial using recursion.
- **FibonacciSeries.java** — Recursive Fibonacci sequence.
- **SumOfNumbers.java** — Sum of first 'n' natural numbers using recursion.
- **Exponent.java** — Recursive exponentiation.
- **Combination.java** — Recursive approach for calculating combinations (nCr).
- **TowerOfHanoi.java** — Solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle recursively.
- **HeadRecursion.java** — Demonstration of head recursion pattern.
- **TailRecursion.java** — Demonstration of tail recursion optimization pattern.
- **TreeRecursion.java** — Example of tree recursion and its expansion behavior.

## Purpose

This repository was created as part of my journey to:
- Practice classic recursion problems.
- Understand and compare different recursion patterns (head, tail, tree).
- Develop a structured reference for teaching or reviewing recursion fundamentals.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahaad-abbadi/Recursions.git
```

2. Open the `.java` files in your IDE of choice.

3. Run and experiment with the methods.
